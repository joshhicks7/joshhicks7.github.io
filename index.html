As you can also tell that's not all I like to do nor is that all I can do. I guess I can tell you a little about me.This is what I like to do.   I can do a backflip, code, and I can do a belly roll. I did competitive cheer for 10 years. I did power tumbling for sometime shorter than that. I was pretty good to be completely honest. My ultimate passion though has to be programming. I code and code. Whatever comes to my head I create. It could be a game about rocket ships or something as simple as finding the average of two numbers. </div>
